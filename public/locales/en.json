    "k6FeatureDescription": "Simulate traffic to find performance bottlenecks before your users do.",
    "k6HowItWorks": "<strong>How it Works:</strong> K6 Commander abstracts the complexity of running load tests. When you configure a test in the UI, the application dynamically generates a k6 JavaScript file. It then spins up a dedicated `grafana/k6` Docker container, passing your configuration (URL, method, headers, VUs, stages, etc.) as environment variables.",
    "k6HowItWorks2": "As the test runs, the k6 engine sends detailed performance metrics (like `http_req_duration`, `http_req_failed`, `vus`) over the local Docker network to an InfluxDB container. InfluxDB, a high-performance time-series database, stores this data. Simultaneously, a pre-configured Grafana instance queries InfluxDB in real-time, displaying live charts and statistics on a dashboard. This gives you immediate insight into how your application performs under stress.",
    "lighthouseFeatureTitle": "Lighthouse Audits",
    "lighthouseFeatureDescription": "Audit for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO with Google's industry-standard tool.",
    "lighthouseHowItWorks": "<strong>How it Works:</strong> This feature leverages Google Lighthouse directly, executed within the application's backend environment. When you start a Lighthouse audit, the server spawns a new process running `npx lighthouse`. It programmatically launches a headless instance of Google Chrome to navigate to your target URL and collect data.",
    "lighthouseHowItWorks2": "Lighthouse then runs its full suite of audits, analyzing everything from page load performance and image optimization to accessibility standards (ARIA attributes, color contrast) and basic SEO checks. The results are saved as both a JSON object for the summary view in the UI and a full, interactive HTML report that you can open for a granular, shareable deep-dive into every metric and recommendation.",
    "seoFeatureTitle": "AI-Powered SEO Analysis",
    "seoFeatureDescription": "Go beyond basic checks with a deep, AI-driven analysis of on-page SEO factors.",
    "seoHowItWorks": "<strong>How it Works:</strong> This isn't just a simple tag checker; it's an AI agent. When you initiate an SEO analysis, a Genkit flow is triggered. This flow first fetches the raw HTML content of the target URL. It then sends this HTML to the Gemini model with a specialized, engineered prompt.",
    "seoHowItWorks2": "This prompt instructs the AI to act as an expert Technical SEO Analyst. It analyzes the content for critical elements like title tags, meta descriptions, H1 headings, canonical URLs, and Open Graph tags. For each element, it determines if it's present and optimal. If an element is missing or could be improved (e.g., a title tag is too long), the AI generates a concise, actionable recommendation, providing you with expert-level advice on how to fix it.",
