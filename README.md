# K6 Commander

K6 Commander is a lightweight, local-first, authorized load-testing platform. It allows you to configure, run, and analyze load tests, Lighthouse audits, and basic SEO checks directly from a sleek web UI, leveraging the power of k6, InfluxDB, and Grafana.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for performance testing **your own applications** where you have explicit permission to do so. Unauthorized testing of third-party websites is illegal and unethical. The creators of this software are not responsible for its misuse.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Node.js (for package management if you wish to modify the code)
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/k6-commander.git
cd k6-commander
```

### 2. Build and Run with Docker Compose

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
1.  Build the Next.js application's Docker image.
2.  Pull the required images for InfluxDB and Grafana.
3.  Start all services (`app`, `influxdb`, `grafana`).

Once the services are up, you can access:

- **K6 Commander UI**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Grafana Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)
  - Login with default credentials: `admin` / `admin`. You will be prompted to change the password on first login.

### 3. Running Your First Test

1.  Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2.  Accept the terms of service.
3.  Fill in the "New Test Run" form with the URL you want to audit.
4.  Select the test suites to run (Load Test, Lighthouse, SEO).
5.  If running a load test, choose a preset or configure it manually.
6.  Click "Run Test(s)".
7.  Monitor the "Test Running" view. For load tests, a link to the live Grafana dashboard will be available.
8.  Once the test is complete, a summary report will be displayed.
